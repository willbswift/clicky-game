A React memory game

This is the ReadMe file for my clicky-game React program. It was the assignment for the 17th week at Web Developer Boot Camp.  Its titled "History of Starfleet Insignia" and it presents the users with an overview of all the different insignia found on the uniforms of the UFP's Starfleet over the centuries. 

To play the game go to the Heroku hosted site https://powerful-bastion-41233.herokuapp.com/

The goal is to click on each insignia once and only once.  However, because each click scrambles the order the insignia are presented in, the user must carefully remember which ones they have already clicked on.  If you click on the same insignia twice then the game resets and your score returns to zero. The game will keep track of the highest score you made in a given session, and will alert you when you make a correct, or incorrect choice.  It also alerts you when you win.      

This is a challenging test that requires either either a keen memory, or in depth knowledge of the uniform insignias worn in various Star Trek shows and movies. 

Hint: If you happen to be a really big Star Trek fan then I found it easiest to click on the emblems in the order they were released (either chronologically or in production release order).
